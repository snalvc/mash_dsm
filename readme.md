# Motivation
RP2040 has dual-core ARM Cortex M0+ which run at 133Mhz top.

How good can we achieve with one core dedicated to delta-sigma modulation and the other core dedicated to the control loop?

Also, RP2040 comes with interesting such as interpolator and PIO which can help us implement the modulator.
